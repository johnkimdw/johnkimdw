# hi im john

i like cooking, dancing, and dogs.
i dont like the first and last together.

i also code :)

## my research interests

still refining my research tastes. right now though, it is on building trustworthy, reliable ai systems (llms)
1) better evaluations to identify failure modes before they reach end-users (benchmarking)
2) understand why these failure modes occur (interpretability)
3) and fix/align models to prevent them (steering)

i also like open-source work, especially dspy, and programming ai, not prompting
