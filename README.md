# hi im john

i like cooking, dancing, and dogs.
i dont like the first and last together.

i also code :)

## my research interests

still refining my research tastes. right now though, it is on building trustworthy, reliable ai systems (llms). more specifically:
1) build rigorous evaluations to identify safety issues (benchmarking)
2) understand why these failures occur (interpretability)
3) align models to prevent them (steering)

i also like open-source work, especially dspy, and programming ai, not prompting
